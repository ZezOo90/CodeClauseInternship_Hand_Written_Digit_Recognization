# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using popular libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset from Keras is used in this project. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). The dataset is preprocessed and ready for training the deep learning model.

## Results

The deep learning model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the MNIST test set. It demonstrates effective recognition of handwritten digits with high precision.


## Acknowledgments

- The MNIST dataset is provided by Keras.
- Special thanks to the creators and contributors of Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn for their amazing libraries.
